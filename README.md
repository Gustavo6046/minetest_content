# minetest_content

I wrote some code to help Python users look at Minetest packages
and ContentDB. Please do not rely on this for production - it is
mostly a proof of concept, and doesn't include that many useful
utilities anyway.

What this does provide, is a way to access Minetest package metadata
online, as well as a nice attrs-based representation for it.
